This program demonstrates how to handle files in Python using different modes. First, it takes a string from the user and writes it to output.txt using 'w' mode. Then, it asks for a second string and uses 'a' mode to append it to the end of the same file so the original data isn't lost. Finally, it opens the file in read mode to show the complete content on the screen.
